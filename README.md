I made a flower shop app in android, the app contains 3 sections with different products of the bussines owner, this sections are in 3 tabs what are in the menu of the app, the menu is caught on bottom of the screen, every products are saved in a table from a local database made in sqlite with different fields for id product, the title, the description, type of the product (bouquet, trinket and products for events like wedding), the 4 tab from the menu is the shopping cart, for this i made a second table in the local database were i saved the products which user are added. The details about the delivery are take it from the fields of the app and made an email which are send to the bussines owner.
